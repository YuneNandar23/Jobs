                    This is job finding website, and developed by Yune Nandar Maung. <br> <br>
                    The main technology used in this website is HTML, CSS and PHP. <br> <br>
                    The framework I used for this website is Laravel Model View Controller framework.
                    I used database seeeding to save the default admin's bank account.

                    There are three main revenue "Ad section in home screen, and business advertising in home screen". This one get money physically at our office. <br> <br>
                    The next one is registration of employee account, we take 15.0000 MMK from their credit account just once when they register. <br> <br>
                    The last one is posting, we don't get money by registeration of company account. But, every company has to pay 500 MMK for each post that they want to publish
